/*
* ==========================================================================
* Hidden attribute
*
* Make the [hidden] global HTML attribute much more useful.
* It's intended to be used to hide elements, but since it's not `!important`
* by default, it's normally trumped by mere CSS classes that were only meant
* to set a default `display` value. Making it `!important` (which is fine
* because this is a utility attribute) corrects this shortcoming.
